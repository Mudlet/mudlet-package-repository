                  "description": "# Achaea Chat Tabs\n\nSet of chat tabs similarly laid out to KaiUI, but using demonnic's latest version of EMCO which provides for automatic logging among other things, and not part of an all or nothing UI.\n\nBy default, the logs are kept in `getMudletHomeDir() .. \"/log/Chatbox/YYYY/MM/DD/tabname.html\"`\n\nWill start on the right side, attached to the right border. Resize, move, adjust how you see fit.\n\n## Configuration Alias\n* `act|act usage`\n  * prints a list of aliases and their usage in the main window\n* `act hide`\n  * hides the chat tabs\n* `act show`\n  * shows the chat tabs again.\n* `act save`\n  * saves the configuration\n* `act load`\n  * loads the configuration\n* `act font <new font name>`\n  * Sets the font for the chat consoles. Will not allow you to set one which does not exist.\n* `act fontSize <new font size>`\n  * Sets the font size for the chat consoles\n* `act blink <true|false>`\n  * set whether it should blink\n* `act timestamp <true|false>`\n  * set whether it should add a timestamp at the front\n* `act commandLine <true|false>`\n  * set whether it should show command lines\n* `act blankLine`\n  * set whether it should automatically add a newline to things echoed.\n* `act gaglist`\n  * lists the mobs and lines being gagged in the chat tabs.\n* `act gagmob <Lua pattern>`\n  * add a Lua pattern to check speakers against. See [this tutorial from lua-users.org](http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial) for more information. If the speaker matches the pattern, anything they say or emote on any channel will be gagged from the tabbed chat consoles. Does not affect the main window. Uses gmcp.Comm.Channel.Text.talker to make the determination.\n    * `act gagmob Vellis`\n      * gags any mob with \"Vellis\" in the speaker name in gmcp.\n    * `act gagmob a sick .+ child`\n      * gags `a sick human child` and `a sick tsol child` and `a sick mhun child` etc\n* `act ungagmob <Lua pattern>`\n  * Removes a lua pattern from the gagged mobs list.\n* `act gag <Lua pattern>`\n  * add a Lua pattern to check lines against. See [this tutorial from lua-users.org](http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial) for more information. If the content of the line matches any of the patterns then the line will be gagged from the tabbed chat consoles. Does not affect the main window.\n    * `act gag .- shouts \"I love cheese!\"`\n      * will gag anyone shouting \"I love cheese!\"\n* `act ungag <Lua pattern>`\n  * removes a lua pattern from the gagged lines list.\n* `act notify <tab name>`\n  * will send OS notifications when somethings is written to the tab specified. If a tab is not provided, will give a list of tabs that currently have notify enabled.\n    * `act notify guild`\n      * sends OS notifications whenever something comes in on the Guild tab\n* `act unnotify <tab name>`\n  * Stop sending OS notifications for a tab\n   * `act unnotify house`\n    * stop sending OS notifications when something comes in on the House tab\n* `act color <option> <color>`\n  * customize the colors of the chat window\n   * `act color usage`\n    * prints the color alias usage information\n* `act update`\n  * updates the package to the latest version\n* `act reset|act reset color`\n  * resets the chat window to defaults/resets chat colors only (remember to 'act save' after to save the defaults into the config file)\n\n## Power Users\nEMCO is a highly customizable chat script with a plethora of options to make it better/smarter/good looking that are by no means limited by only these aliases! If you want to further customize your chat box and its behavior refer to the [EMCO API](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/classes/EMCO.html).\n",

For example, Alt+1 would retrieve the most recent message, while Alt+5 would retrieve the fifth most, and Alt+0 would retrieve the tenth most recent message. While holding alt, double tapping a number will have its message copied to the clipboard.\n\nTo add a new message to any given buffer, simply call `channel_history.add(STR category_name, STR message)`. Here's an example of a regular expression trigger:\n\n`\\[(chat|advice|events)\\] (\\w+)(.+s)`\n\nAnd, how this information is parsed and passed along to `channel_history:add()`\n\n```\nlocal where = matches[2]\nlocal message = matches[3] .. \": \" .. matches[4]\nchannel_history.add(where, message)\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nAs much of this project is a port from channel_history.xml from MushZ, thanks goes out to its authors:\n* Tyler Spivey\n* Oriol Gomez\n* Weyoun\n\nThanks also goes to Demonnic for graciously offering assistance with questions related to Muddler, which is used to package this project, and for helping with debugging some initial code. And of course, to the Mudlet team as a hole for creating a fast, powerful, and feature-rich MUD client.\n",

It can schedule down to the nearest minute and as far out as once per year.\n\nA job is a table that is passed to the cron monitor specifying when to execute a command.\n\nThe job daemon/monitor will wake up once per minute as the minute ticks over to execute any matching jobs.  It relies on your operating system time for\naccuracy.\n\nWish to see further additions to this script? Consider supporting my efforts at https://buymeacoffee.com/zookaongit\n\n### Usage\n    cron help   - to see this help\n    cron [list] - to see a list of scheduled jobs\n\n#### Time Formats\nhour (0..23)\n\nminute (0..59)\n\nday (1..31, of the month)\n\nweekday (0..6, Sunday is 0)\n\nmonth (1..12)\n\nTimes can contain ranges 1-3, enumerations 1-3,5,7 or * (every time).\n\ne.g.\n\nhour = \"*\" - match every hour\n\nday = \"1,10,20\" - match 1st, 10th, 20th of each month only\n\nweekday = \"1-3\" - match Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday only\n\nmonth = \"1,10-12\" - match January, October, November, December only\n\nJobs must contain all time entries as mentioned above.\n\nJobs must match EVERY entry before they will fire (use * for always).\n\n#### Job Commands\nThe command field is the function name to run without parenthesis.\n\nCommands are specified in two common formats;\n    command = functionName,\n    command = function() send(\"look\") end,\n\nCron functions in the first format do not accept arguments, use the second format to bring in variables for more elaborate jobs or multiple commands/functions.\n\n#### ID\nUsed to identify a particular job, typically unique.  Jobs can have the same name, but deleting one will delete only one of the jobs with the same ID.\n\n#### Job Examples\n\n    -- perform myFunction() every minute\n    local job1 = { id = \"my first job\",\n                   command = myFunction,\n                   hour = \"*\",\n                   minute = \"*\",\n                   day = \"*\",\n                   weekday = \"*\",\n                   month = \"*\"\n                 }\n    \n    -- go to work at 8:15am, but only on weekdays\n    local job2 = { id = \"off to work\",\n                   command = function()\n                        echo(\"You'll be late for work!\")\n                        disconnect()\n                   end,\n                   hour = \"8\",\n                   minute = \"15\",\n                   day = \"*\",\n                   weekday = \"1-5\",\n                   month = \"*\"\n                }\n    \n    -- Wishing you a happy birthday (at 10am, Jan 31st)\n    local job3 = { id = \"birthday\",\n                   command = function()\n                        echo(\"Happy Birthday!\")\n                   end,\n                   hour = \"10\",\n                   minute = \"0\",\n                   day = \"31\",\n                   weekday = \"*\",\n                   month = \"1\"\n                }\n    \n    -- add them to the scheduler\n    cron.add(job1)\n    cron.add(job2)\n    cron.add(job3)\n\n    -- delete them later\n    cron.delete(\"my first job\")\n    -- or alternatively\n    cron.delete(job2.id)",

Since we use busted for testing Mudlet itself I thought it would be good to get a version repackaged which Mudlet users could install for their own use.\n## Usage\n\nThis comes with one alias, `runTests`. By default, it will look for every file in your profile directory named `*_spec.lua` and run the tests defined within. If you wish to only run tests for a specific package, you can use the package name as the argument to the alias, for instance `runTests REPLet` will run any test files in the REPLet package if installed. If you want to run a specific test file, you can use `runTests REPLet/coreTests_spec.lua` to point to the specific file.\n\n## Writing tests\n\nThere are some very good [docs](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/) available from the authors. For some practical examples, you can check out the [Mudlet busted tests](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/tree/development/src/mudlet-lua/tests)\n\n## TO-DO\n\nI have not yet included the libraries to enable asynchronous testing (libev and the copas and lua-libev luarocks) so you won't be able to ",
