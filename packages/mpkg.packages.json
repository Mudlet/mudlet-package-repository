It's highlighted a cool, calming green.\n\nBeen there 5 times? RED ALERT!\n\nPrimarily designed to watch the dots fill in while doing an auto walk, but also to see where it is least efficient, hence the colors getting redder the more you visit.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIt uses the `gmcp.Room.Info` event to determine it's entered a room, and the value of `gmcp.Room.Info.num` to determine which room it was. So if your game doesn't have this, you're out of luck. Should work with all IREs and any game which models its gmcp after the IRE ones.\n\n## Aliases\n\n* `awv start`\n  * starts the visualizer, clearing any previously highlighted rooms it is tracking\n* `awv stop`\n  * stops adding the highlights but does not clear them out, so you can look over them and run the report\n* `awv clear`\n  * stops the visualizer and clears all the highlights.\n* `awv report`\n  * prints a report on number of rooms visited, number of moves to do it, etc.\n\n## API\n\n* `autoWalkVis:start()`\n  * starts the visualizer, clearing any previously highlighted rooms it is tracking\n* `autoWalkVis:stop(clear?)`\n  * stops the visualizer. If argument is true, also clears all the highlights. Data is kept either way for reports.\n* `autoWalkVis:report()`\n  * prints out the stat report for this visualization session\n* `autoWalkVis:clearHighlights()`\n  * clears all the map highlights without clearing the data. Leaves the visualizer on/off state alone.\n* `autoWalkVis:resetGradientAndHighlights()`\n  * This looks over the data and resets the max level of the gradient from 5 to whatever the most times a room was visited was. Then it goes through and adjusts the highlights on all tracked rooms to use the new gradient. Useful if you have a walk which simply must revisit some rooms more than 5 times and want to change the scale for better visualization.\n",

Androids can ignore the speedwalk argument. \nThe following CK constants should be used by organics \n\n1. `learning.recall_isolation` this will get you to an isolation tank from any location on the mud. Mine is \"recall;s;w;enter vort;s\"\n2. `learning.return_to_target` this will get you back to the original target from the recall_isolation constant.  Mine is \"crecall;n;n;n;e;n\" this will change based on target\n\n`autotrain <speedwalk_to_isolation> [<exercise>]` - Start training using exercise, if no exercise is specified then pick on based on current stats.  \n\n`strike <target>` - Strike a target using a Physical attack you can currently afford\n\n`blast <target>` - Blast a target using a Ki Attack you can currently afford\n\n`redeem all` - Redeem all loot boxes until you have no more\n\n`sell all.<thing>` - Sell all of a type of thing to a pawn shop,  `sell all.epic`\n\n`CK` - get a list of CK commands\n\n`CK update` - update the CK script from github\n\n`CK features` - list feature flags\n\n`CK feature <name> <on|off>` - turn the feature on/off\n\n`CK constants` - List Script Constants (These survive resetProfile())\n\n`CK constant <name>=<value>` - Set a Script Constant\n\n`CK pkg` - CK Package Manager\n\n`CK pkg versions` - Show whats currently installed\n\n`CK pkg install <map|chat>` - Get the map or chat scripts\n\n`CK pkg update all` - Upgrade all install packages\n`CK pkg update <name>` - Upgrade named package\n\n`quit` - Quit but disable reconnecting first\n",

For example, Alt+1 would retrieve the most recent message, while Alt+5 would retrieve the fifth most, and Alt+0 would retrieve the tenth most recent message. While holding alt, double tapping a number will have its message copied to the clipboard.\n\nTo add a new message to any given buffer, simply call `channel_history.add(STR category_name, STR message)`. Here's an example of a regular expression trigger:\n\n`\\[(chat|advice|events)\\] (\\w+)(.+s)`\n\nAnd, how this information is parsed and passed along to `channel_history:add()`\n\n```\nlocal where = matches[2]\nlocal message = matches[3] .. \": \" .. matches[4]\nchannel_history.add(where, message)\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nAs much of this project is a port from channel_history.xml from MushZ, thanks goes out to its authors:\n* Tyler Spivey\n* Oriol Gomez\n* Weyoun\n\nThanks also goes to Demonnic for graciously offering assistance with questions related to Muddler, which is used to package this project, and for helping with debugging some initial code. And of course, to the Mudlet team as a hole for creating a fast, powerful, and feature-rich MUD client.\n",

This package takes the EMCO object available as part of the [MDK](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK) and builds a basic, generic chat tabs package out of it.\n\nIt's built using an adjustable container, so it can be moved, resized, etc right out of the box. There are range of aliases with the package which make adding/removing tabs and changing some of the basic themes of the EMCO easier.\n\nYou can leverage the entire [EMCO API](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/classes/EMCO.html) by targeting `demonnic.chat` , as that is the actual underlying EMCO object.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can use the following command in Mudlet to install the latest version:\n\n`lua installPackage(\"https://github.com/demonnic/EMCO/releases/latest/download/EMCOChat.mpackage\")`\n\nOnce you have it installed you can update by using the `emco update` alias.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Copying lines into your EMCO\n\nIf you want to copy a line from the game and send it to EMCO, make a trigger to match the line, and use `demonnic.chat:append(\"tabName\")` to copy the line to the EMCO. For instance, to send a line to the \"Tells\" tab, you would use\n\n```lua\ndemonnic.chat:append(\"Tells\")\n```\n\nIf you want to send lines to the EMCO in code yourself, you can use `demonnic.chat:cecho(\"OOC\", \"This is an OOC message\\n\")`. There is also decho and hecho available the same way.\n\n### Available aliases for the prebuilt EMCO package\n\n* `emco addtab <tabname>`\n  * adds a tab to your EMCO\n* `emco blankLine <true|false>`\n  * turn inserting a blank line between messages on/off\n* `emco blink <true|false>`\n  * turn blinking on/off\n* `emco color <option> <value>`\n  * used to change the colors for the active/inactive tab, and the background color for the consoles. 'emco color' with no options will print out available options\n* `emco font`\n  * set the font to use for the consoles\n* `emco fontSize`\n  * set the font size for the consoles\n* `emco gag <pattern>`\n  * add a gag pattern\n* `emco gaglist`\n  * prints out the list of gag patterns\n* `emco hide`\n  * hide the EMCO\n* `emco load`\n  * loads your config from disk\n* `emco lock`\n  * locks the EMCO in place\n* `emco notify <tabName>`\n  * turn on OS notifications for tabName\n* `emco remtab <tabname>`\n  * removes a tab from your EMCO\n* `emco save`\n  * saves your config to disk\n* `emco show`\n  * show the EMCO\n* `emco timestamp <true|false>`\n  * turn timestamps on/off\n* `emco title <new title>`\n  * Set the title at the top of the EMCO Chat window. \"Tabbed Chat\" is the default starting title.\n* `emco unlock`\n  * Unlocks the EMCO window so you can move and resize it again\n* `emco ungag <pattern>`\n  * remove a gag pattern\n* `emco unnotify <tabName>`\n  * turn off OS notifications for tabName\n* `emco update`\n  * (re)install the latest version of the package\n",

Feel free to clone, copy, and modify as you like.\n\n## Ideas, TODOs, and Known Issues\n\n### Known Issues\n\n- Fix the \"City of\", \"Land of\" bug in the quest area regex. It doesn't always grab the whole location name.\n\n### TODOs\n\n- Make sure all chat channels are properly captured (ongoing).\n- Capture other events (Hero, Legend, etc.)\n- Add global quests details to the top container.\n- Add current debuffs to the bottom or right side of the bottom container.\n- Work on UI help files.\n- [X] DONE - Add Expedition and Junkyard details to the top container.\n- [X] DONE - Create an echo prefix for information coming from the UI: -=[UI]=-  \n- [X] DONE - Re-Colorize pet HP.\n- [X] DONE - Add the rest of the long class/subclass names (>10 chars) to the left container Class section.\n- [X] DONE - Implement a theming system!\n\n### Ideas\n\n- Get the Mudlet mapper setup.\n- Incorporate Waypoints in custom runtos.\n- Track AutoSkill and KillSkill.\n- Add weather and moon cycles to the lower right.\n- Add a Global Quest alert for your level range.\n- Clean up the top container notifications. Maybe split the top with an HBox?\n  - This would allow for static notifications on the right and quest, etc. stuff on the left.\n- Add a spot to list all mobs in a room.\n  - Maybe move Events to the top container and use its left space as a mob list?\n",

                  "description": "# the demonnic MDK and You\n\nThis is a collection of Lua 'classes' and modules I wrote for Mudlet. It is largely targeted at scripters, and comes packaged in two ways depending on how you intend to use/distribute your work. Please see [Installation](#installation) for more details\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [MDK wiki](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki) contains an entry for each module or class, as well as examples.\n\nStarting with alpha2 of the MDK, the ldocs generated from code are included in the zipped releases. The current release's ldocs can always be viewed at <https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/>\n\n## Installation\n\nHow you 'install' the MDK depends on how you intend to use it.\n\n### I just want to install the MDK for my own personal use\n\nYou just want to get your hands on the goods, and aren't looking to use any MDK items in an exported package for sharing or anything like that.\nWell, you are who the mdk mpackage is for! Download the MDK.mpackage from your desired release on the [Releases](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/releases) page and install it in the package manager. The examples in the [wiki](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/) are written with this in mind, and you would require the items you need as `local EMCO = require(\"MDK.emco\")`\n\n### I am a package author looking to include/use one of the MDK modules or classes in my package\n\nYou should download the `demonnic-MDK-<version>.zip` file for your desired release on the [Releases](https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/releases) page.\nInside are the individual .lua files for the modules and classes described in the [wiki](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/) and [API docs](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/).\nYou can include all of them if you wish, or only the ones you actually make use of. I ask that you include the LICENSE.lua or LICENSE-MDK.lua file (depending on the release) file in addition.\nThey should go in the root of your package, so that when your package is installed the files can be found at `getMudletHomeDir() .. \"/<packagename>/emco.lua\"`. You would then use `local EMCO = require(\"<mypackagename>.emco\")`\nSo for example if your package name is \"MySuperCoolPackage\" and it installs to `getMudletHomeDir() .. \"/MySuperCoolPackage/\"` then you use `local EMCO = require(\"MySuperCoolPackage.emco\")` and the emco.lua file should be at `getMudletHomeDir() .. \"/MySuperCoolPackage/emco.lua\"`\n\n## Files (Modules/Classes)\n\nThese files contain the modules in the MDK. You only need to include those files which you intend to use, except as noted in the descriptions below.\nIf you include any of the modules from the MDK, you should also include LICENSE.lua or LICENSE-MDK.lua. It contains the licenses for my modules and for luaunit and lua-schema which are not my original works.\nYou should maybe also include demontools.lua, as it notes below several other of the MDK modules make use of items within it.\n\n* aliasmgr.ua\n  * Object to manage tempAliases programmatically. <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/AliasMgr>\n  \n* chyron.lua\n  * Label which moves a message across its face from right to left, like a stock ticker or the news chyrons. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/Chyron>\n\n* demontools.lua\n  * Collection of miscellaneous useful functions. You should include this file if you use the MDK, as several other modules make use of it. Include functions for converting c/d/hecho, html, and ansi colored strings between each other, mkdir_p, and some others. <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/DemonTools>\n\n* emco.lua\n  * EMCO. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/EMCO> Will make use of LoggingConsole if loggingconsole.lua and demontools.lua are included\n\n* figlet.lua\n  * Creates FIGlets from strings\n  * Reference package with multiple fonts and color gradients at <https://github.com/demonnic/figinator>\n\n* ftext.lua\n  * basic fText. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/fText>\n  * now includes TextFormatter and TableMaker as ftext.TextFormatter and ftext.TableMaker\n\n* gradientmaker.lua\n  * Functions for creating color gradients for use with c/d/hecho. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/GradientMaker>\n\n* loggingconsole.lua\n  * Self logging extension to the mini console. Works just like a Geyser.MiniConsole but adds a templated path and fileName constraint, as well as logFormat so it can log what is echod or appended to it. Requires demontools.lua in order to work.\n\n* loginator.lua\n  * Creates objects for logging messages to disk. <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/Loginator>\n\n* mastermindsolver.lua\n  * A class which will help you solve Master Mind puzzles. <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/MasterMindSolver>\n\n* revisionator.lua\n  * A class which aims to make upgrading between package versions easier by storing and running patch functions. <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/Revisionator>\n\n* sortbox.lua\n  * SortBox, an alternative to H/VBox which can be either, and also provides options for sorting its contents. Overview at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/SortBox>\n\n* spinbox.lua\n  * SpinBox, a Geyser element for adjusting numbers with your mouse. Overview at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/SpinBox>\n\n* sug.lua\n  * Self Updating Gauges, will watch a set of variables and update itself on a timer based on what values those variables hold. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/SelfUpdatingGauge>\n\n* textgauge.lua\n  * TextGauges, what it says on the tin. Documentation at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/TextGauge>\n\n* timergauge.lua\n  * TimerGauge, an extension of Geyser.Gauge which serves as an animated countdown timer. Overview at <https://github.com/demonnic/MDK/wiki/TimerGauge>\n\n## Others people's work I depend upon\n\n* schema.lua\n  * lua-schema, for defining table schema. Documentation at <https://github.com/sschoener/lua-schema>\n  * will be used by Archon for ensuring configuration tables are as they should be.\n\n* LICENSE.lua\n  * Contains the license information for MDK, as well as lua-schema and luaunit which have been included.\n",

Since we use busted for testing Mudlet itself I thought it would be good to get a version repackaged which Mudlet users could install for their own use.\n## Usage\n\nThis comes with one alias, `runTests`. By default, it will look for every file in your profile directory named `*_spec.lua` and run the tests defined within. If you wish to only run tests for a specific package, you can use the package name as the argument to the alias, for instance `runTests REPLet` will run any test files in the REPLet package if installed. If you want to run a specific test file, you can use `runTests REPLet/coreTests_spec.lua` to point to the specific file.\n\n## Writing tests\n\nThere are some very good [docs](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/) available from the authors. For some practical examples, you can check out the [Mudlet busted tests](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/tree/development/src/mudlet-lua/tests)\n\n## TO-DO\n\nI have not yet included the libraries to enable asynchronous testing (libev and the copas and lua-libev luarocks) so you won't be able to ",

Also adds rdisplay, which works like display() but prints to the REPLet console. If this covers over functions you already have and want to use in the console, use `addEchos false` in the REPLet console's command line.\n\n## Why REPLet?\n\nREPL is an acronym which stands for `Read Execute Print Loop` and is the term for interactive code runners like this.

It can schedule down to the nearest minute and as far out as once per year.\n\nA job is a table that is passed to the cron monitor specifying when to execute a command.\n\nThe job daemon/monitor will wake up once per minute as the minute ticks over to execute any matching jobs.  It relies on your operating system time for\naccuracy.\n\nWish to see further additions to this script? Consider supporting my efforts at https://buymeacoffee.com/zookaongit\n\n### Usage\n    cron help   - to see this help\n    cron [list] - to see a list of scheduled jobs\n\n#### Time Formats\nhour (0..23)\n\nminute (0..59)\n\nday (1..31, of the month)\n\nweekday (0..6, Sunday is 0)\n\nmonth (1..12)\n\nTimes can contain ranges 1-3, enumerations 1-3,5,7 or * (every time).\n\ne.g.\n\nhour = \"*\" - match every hour\n\nday = \"1,10,20\" - match 1st, 10th, 20th of each month only\n\nweekday = \"1-3\" - match Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday only\n\nmonth = \"1,10-12\" - match January, October, November, December only\n\nJobs must contain all time entries as mentioned above.\n\nJobs must match EVERY entry before they will fire (use * for always).\n\n#### Job Commands\nThe command field is the function name to run without parenthesis.\n\nCommands are specified in two common formats;\n    command = functionName,\n    command = function() send(\"look\") end,\n\nCron functions in the first format do not accept arguments, use the second format to bring in variables for more elaborate jobs or multiple commands/functions.\n\n#### ID\nUsed to identify a particular job, typically unique.  Jobs can have the same name, but deleting one will delete only one of the jobs with the same ID.\n\n#### Job Examples\n\n    -- perform myFunction() every minute\n    local job1 = { id = \"my first job\",\n                   command = myFunction,\n                   hour = \"*\",\n                   minute = \"*\",\n                   day = \"*\",\n                   weekday = \"*\",\n                   month = \"*\"\n                 }\n    \n    -- go to work at 8:15am, but only on weekdays\n    local job2 = { id = \"off to work\",\n                   command = function()\n                        echo(\"You'll be late for work!\")\n                        disconnect()\n                   end,\n                   hour = \"8\",\n                   minute = \"15\",\n                   day = \"*\",\n                   weekday = \"1-5\",\n                   month = \"*\"\n                }\n    \n    -- Wishing you a happy birthday (at 10am, Jan 31st)\n    local job3 = { id = \"birthday\",\n                   command = function()\n                        echo(\"Happy Birthday!\")\n                   end,\n                   hour = \"10\",\n                   minute = \"0\",\n                   day = \"31\",\n                   weekday = \"*\",\n                   month = \"1\"\n                }\n    \n    -- add them to the scheduler\n    cron.add(job1)\n    cron.add(job2)\n    cron.add(job3)\n\n    -- delete them later\n    cron.delete(\"my first job\")\n    -- or alternatively\n    cron.delete(job2.id)",

                  "description": "# Highlighter\n\nThis package aims to be a game agnostic word/name highlighter. There are several different packages I've seen for this but they are all geared towards a specific game or lacked much in the way of configurability.\n\n## Quick start\n\nTo quickly see it in action, you can try the following commands from the Mudlet input line after installing the package\n\n```txt\nhl cat add enemy#bold = true\n```\n\n```txt\nhl item add enemy#Bob\n```\n\n```txt\n`echo Then to your dismay a wild Bob appeared!\n```\n\nTo clean up afterwards\n\n```txt\nhl item remove Bob\n```\n\n## Aliases\n\nAll aliases start with `hl`. Some of them get a little bit expressive, but the [API](#API) section will show you how to write your own shorter aliases. Since category names and items to be highlights both can contain spaces, I settled on using `#` as a separator for my aliases. If you need to highlight something with a `#` in it then the [API](#API) can help you out.\n\n* `hl cat list`\n  * Displays a list of the categories you have configured.\n* `hl cat add <Category#options>`\n  * this is the alias you use to add categories to the Highlighter.\n  * category is the name of the category. Can contain spaces.\n  * options is a comma separated list of options and their values.\n    * `fg = \"<127,0,0>\", bold = true`\n    * Available options\n      * fg\n        * the color to make the text. Can be specified as a color name (\"red\"), decho style (\"<255,0,0>\"), or hecho style (\"#ff0000\")\n        * defaults to false (uncolored)\n      * bg\n        * the same as fg, but the background of the text.\n        * defaults to false (uncolored)\n      * bold\n        * if true, highlight is bold. If false then highlight is unbolded if originally bold.\n        * defaults to false\n      * italics\n        * if true, item will be italicized. If false it will not be\n        * defaults to false\n      * underline\n        * if true, item will be underlined. If false it will not be\n        * defaults to false\n      * paused\n        * if true, items in this category will not actually be highlighted, but will still be tracked\n        * defaults to false\n  * Examples:\n    * `hl cat add enemy#fg = \"red\", bold = true`\n    * `hl cat add quest items#italics = true`\n* `hl item add <Category#Item>`\n  * used to add a highlight item\n  * to move an item from one category to another, simply add it to the new category\n  * both category and item may contain spaces.\n  * Examples\n    * `hl item add enemy#Bob`\n    * `hl item add quest items#a purple crystal`\n* `hl item remove <item>`\n  * used to remove an item from the highlighter\n  * an item can only belong to one category at a time, so category needn't be specified.\n* `hl cat display <category>`\n  * displays the configuration and items for the given category.\n* `hl cat remove <category>`\n  * removes a category from the highlighter, including all of its items\n  * use with caution\n* `hl cat clear <category>`\n  * removes all of the items from a category, but leaves the category and configuration in place.\n  * use with caution\n* `hl cat update <category#config>`\n  * just like `hl cat add` but updates the config of an existing category\n  * Does not **replace** the config, but updates any item included, so if it has a fg and you only pass in `bold = true` for the options then it will have both bold and the fg which was set\n  * Examples\n    * `hl cat update enemy#bold = true`\n    * `hl cat update riders of the bleeding eyeball#italics = false, bg = \"red\", fg = \"yellow\"`\n* `hl save`\n  * saves your highlighter configs and items to disk\n  * automatically done when you close the profile or uninstall the package\n* `hl load`\n  * loads your highlighter info from disk.\n  * automatically done when you load the profile or reinstall the package.\n* `hl pause <category>`\n  * pauses the specific category\n* `hl pause`\n  * pauses all categories\n* `hl unpause <category>`\n  * unpauses the specific category\n* `hl unpause`\n  * unpauses all categories\n\n## API\n\nThere are several functions you can make use of yourself for creating aliases or triggers that interact with the Highlighter.\n\n* `Highlighter:addCategory(name, options)`\n  * adds a category to the Highlighter\n  * name must be a string, can contain spaces\n  * options is a table of key/value options.\n    * Available options\n      * fg\n        * the color to make the text.

                  "description": "# Demonwalker\n\n## Installation\n\nSimply put `lua installPackage(\"https://github.com/demonnic/demonnicAutoWalker/releases/latest/download/demonnicAutoWalker.mpackage\")` in your Mudlet command line and it will download and install the latest version of the package from Github for you. If you already have it installed you can use the `dwalk update` alias if you have version 3.3 or higher.\n\n## What is this thing\n\nThis Mudlet package ties in to the events and functions presented by the IRE mudlet mapper script. It will walk to every room in an area, raising an event when it gets to the target room and waiting for you to raise an event telling it to move to the next room. Alternately you can pass it a table of room IDs to visit and it will visit those room IDs specifically rather than every room in an area.\n\nSo you could, for instance, use this to write a set of scripts and triggers which moved to a room, checks that room for a gemstone node and if it sees one sends \"mine gemstone\", if it does not sends the event to move on to the next unchecked room. Then the auto walker will determine which of the next unchecked rooms is closest, move to it, and tell you it has arrived in a new unchecked room.\n\nIf it can't get to a room, it just moves on to the next.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n* `demonwalker:init()`\n  * see entry for demonwalker:init() in [Functions](#functions) for more advanced usage. Called like this it will walk each room in the current area.\n* start loop\n* listen for event \"demonwalker.arrived\"\n* do whatever you need to do in the demonwalker.arrived event handler\n* `raiseEvent(\"demonwalker.move\")`\n* repeat loop\n\n## Stop moving now, please\n\n### Via lua\n\n`raiseEvent(\"demonwalker.stop\")`\n\n### Via alias\n\n`dwalk stop`\n\n## Configuration\n\n* demonwalker.config.returnToStart\n  * when true, will go back to the room where you started the autowalker when it is done (either all rooms visited, or demonwalker.stop event received)\n* demonwalker.config.breadth\n  * When asked to find the next room to move to, it will search this many rooms away from your current room before falling back to checking the distance to all the remaining rooms and choosing the shortest one. Defaults to 10\n* demonwalker.config.avoidList\n  * list of roomIDs to avoid in **all** walks. demonwalker:addAvoidRoom(roomID) and demonwalker:removeAvoidRoom(roomID) to add/remove items from the list. This table uses roomIDs as keys, it's advised not to alter it directly. See also the dwalk alias below\n\n## Alias\n\n* `dwalk`\n  * prints out the demonwalker configuration.\n* `dwalk usage`\n  * prints out usage information for dwalk alias set\n* `dwalk report`\n  * prints out the performance report for current walk, or last one completed if you're not currently using demonwalker.\n* `dwalk explore`\n  * automatically explores an area, moving to each new room without stopping\n* `dwalk stop`\n  * stops demonwalker. Equivalent to raising the \"demonwalker.stop\" event\n* `dwalk move`\n  * Tells the walker to move on. Equivalent to raising the \"demonwalker.move\" event\n* `dwalk avoidList`\n  * prints out the global list of rooms to avoid in **all** walks\n* `dwalk avoid <roomID>`\n  * adds roomID to the global avoid list.\n* `dwalk unavoid <roomID>`\n  * removes roomID from the global avoid list.\n* `dwalk breadth <newBreadth>`\n  * Sets the number of rooms to search from your current one, before just checking all the remaining rooms for the closest. Defaults to 10, and you'll likely never need to change it.\n* `dwalk returnToStart <true/false>`\n  * Set returnToStart value. If true, will return to the room the walk started in when it's stopped/finished.\n* `dwalk debug <true/false>`\n  * Used to turn on/off debug. Will be kind of spammy if turned on, and mostly useful during development.\n* `dwalk update`\n  * Updates the package to the latest version from github.\n\n## Functions\n\n* demonwalker:addAvoidRoom(roomID)\n  * adds a room ID to the list of rooms to not include in **any** walks\n* demonwalker:removeAvoidRoom(roomID)\n  * removes a room ID from the list of rooms to not include in **any** walks\n* demonwalker:init(options)\n  * starts a walk. Options an optional table of options. Valid keys are\n    * rooms: a list of roomIDs to visit. IE {1, 2, 4, 10} . If not provided will be the list of all rooms in the area.\n    * avoidRooms: a list of roomIDs to make sure is not included in **this** walk. Not saved between walks.\n    * searchTargets: a list of items to check for. IE {\"a thief on a leaf\", \"a dracnari hunk\", \"a dracnari dreamer\"}.\n      * If this list is provided, then demonwalker will check every room for each of these items, and if any of them are found then and only then will it raise `demonwalker.arrived`. This makes it easy to automate looking for one or more creatures or items in an area, without worrying about stopping the walker yourself.\n      * If you start an entry with `\"Match:\"` then it will use string.match to check for targets/items. For instance, `\"Match:Drakt\"` will stop for anything with `Drakt` in the name at all.\n* demonwalker:performanceReport()\n  * prints out some performance information on the current walk if still running a walk, or the last walk if one has been completed.\n* demonwalker:getFailedRooms()\n  * Returns a table of roomIDs which could not be reached by demonwalker during the most recent walk.\n\n## Events\n\n### Listens for\n\n* demonwalker.move\n  * when this event is raised, if mmp is paused it will unpause it so it starts walking again. If it is not paused, then it will choose the closest unvisited room and begin walking to it.\n* demonwalker.stop\n  * when this event is raise, the current walk will end, and if demonwalker.config.returnToStart is true it will move back to the room the walk began in.\n* mmapper arrived\n  * when this event is raised, it means the speedwalk has ended and we're at the room we were moving to. demonwalker then does some housekeeping and raises `demonwalker.arrived`\n* mmapper failed path\n  * when this event is raised it means the speedwalk could not continue, so we make sure to remove the room we were moving to and then pick the next one and move to it\n\n### Raises\n\n* demonwalker.arrived\n  * raised when we have arrived at a new room, or a room which contains an item/mob we've been told to stop for. Should be listened for in order to signal that it is time to \"do the thing\", whatever that might be.\n* demonwalker.finished\n  * raised when the overall walk is finished, whether because it ran out of rooms to move to, or it was stopped using the `demonwalker.stop` event. Raised before the walk to the starting room is finished, to do something when that occurs listen for demonwalker.finished to register a one-time event handler for `mmapper arrived`\n\n## Porting\n\nIt wouldn't be too difficult to port this to other mappers, but it would need:\n\n* a function to call which starts the scripts autowalk procedure (mmp.gotoRoom in IRE mapper)\n* a variable which holds the current roomID for checking (mmp.currentroom in IRE mapper)\n* an event which is raised when an autowalk completes successfully (\"mmapper arrived\" in IRE mapper)\n* an event which is raised when an autowalk fails (\"mmapper failed path\" in IRE mapper)\n* a way to pause, unpause, and check the paused status of the walker\n* game needs to use telnet GA or EOR so that prompt triggers function\n\nThat's really it, everything else is handled by the autowalker.\n\nTODO:\n\n* Make it work with the generic mapping script that ships with Mudlet itself (will require adjustments to the generic mapping script)\n\n* Make implementing the porting items above easier by making them configuration options.\n",

                  "description": "# figinator\n\n## Create ascii art out of text\n\nThe figinator is a Mudlet package designed to put the awesome power of [Figlets](http://figlet.org) right at your finger tips.\n\nExamples of all the included fonts can be font on [the Wiki](https://github.com/demonnic/figinator/wiki)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe fastest way to install the figinator is to run the following alias:\n\n`lua uninstallPackage(\"figinator\") installPackage(\"https://github.com/demonnic/figinator/releases/latest/download/figinator.mpackage\")`\n\nAfter that you can stay up to date using the `fig update` alias. (Available in 1.2+)\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is primarily meant to be used via script for your triggers and the like to present big bold text. But I've included a couple of aliases for trying it out.\n\n### Aliases\n\n* `fig fontlist`\n  * A list of the fonts included in this package and available for use\n* `fig font <fontName>`\n  * Select which figlet font to use\n* `fig demo <fontName>`\n  * Does a demo of the font in regular, kerned, and smushed.\n  * also sets future figs to be drawn in this font. It's a side effect of loading the font.\n* `fig draw <msg>`\n  * Draws `msg` in the currently selected font in the main window\n* `fig kern <msg>`\n  * Draws `msg` in the currently selected font in the main window with kerning\n* `fig smush <msg>`\n  * Draws `msg` in the currently selected font in the main window smushed\n* `fig update`\n  * downloads the latest version of the figinator and installs it.\n\n### API\n\n* `figinator.useFont(fontName)`\n  * Tells the figinator to use the specified font for the next figlet.\n* `figinator.loadOutsideFont(filename)`\n  * Allows you to load arbitrary figlet files not included with the figinator\n* `figinator.getString(msg)`\n  * Returns `msg` as a figlet in strong format, so you can echo() it where you want Puts space between the letters\n* `figinator.getKern(msg)`\n  * Like figinator.getString, but with less space between the letters\n* `figinator.getSmush(msg)`\n  * like figinator.getString, but the letters touch and share edges.\n* `figinator.demoFont(font)`\n  * Demonstrates the font in all three styles using the msg \"Fig Test\". This may take a screen to do all three.\n* `figinator.demoAll()`\n  * Demonstrates all of the fonts. This will be pretty spammy.\n* `figinator.getFancy(options)`\n  * This function does it all! Including interleaving color gradients for use with decho!\n  * options is a table of options to apply. Valid options are:\n    * msg\n      * this one is required, and is the text to make the figlet out of\n    * kern\n      * if true, will apply kerning, reducing the space between the letters\n      * defaults to false\n    * smush\n      * if true, will smush the letters closer, having them share edges where possible\n      * defaults to false\n    * gradType\n      * use either 'h' for horizontal, or 'v' for vertical. \n      * defaults to 'h'\n    * gradient\n      * the actual gradient to use. Can either be a table of gradient stops to use, or the string name of an included gradient\n      * `gradient = {{50,50,50}, {255,0,0}, {50,50,50}}`\n        * would shift from grey to red to grey\n      * `gradient = \"rainbow\"`\n        * will use the included \"rainbow\" gradient\n    * contrastColor\n      * What color to contrast the gradient with.\n      * defaults to 'black'\n      * can use named colors from cecho (such as \"black\", \"white\", \"magenta\"), decho (\"<0,0,0>\", \"<255,255,255>\"), or hecho (\"#000000\", \"#FFFFFF\")\n      * the special color \"invert\" will cause the contrast color to be the inverse of the gradient color. That is to say, if the gradient for a space has `r,g,b` of `128,255,0` then the contrast will be `127,0,255`. This is done for every space.\n    * invert\n      * When this is true then the text will be the contrastColor, and the background will be the gradient color. So if you use the rainbow gradient and the default contrastColor of \"black\" then the background colors will shift through the rainbow, and the text which makes the ascii art will be black.\n  * example:\n    * `decho(figinator.getFancy({ msg = \"Gradient1\", gradient = \"rainbow\", smush = true }))`\n      * Uses the included 'rainbow' gradient horizontally\n    * `decho(figinator.getFancy({ msg = \"Gradient2\", gradient = {{255,0,0}, {0,255,0}} }))`\n      * Will gradient from red to green horizontally\n    * `decho(figinator.getFancy({ msg = \"Gradient3\", gradType = \"v\", kern = true, gradient = {{75,0,0}, {255,0,0}} }))`\n      * Will gradient from dark red to light red, vertically.\n\n## Credit and acclaim\n\nThe figlet lua implementation is primarily the work of Nick Gammon and was taken from [his forum](https://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10748&reply=6#reply6) then modified to be a lua module. And I added some convenience methods for getting strings directly instead of a table of lines.\n\nThen I took that and wrapped it in this package which includes several fonts pulled from [this git repo](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts) and some convenience methods for switching between the included ones easily.\n\nIn short, all the coolest parts of what this does are things other people made, I'm just trying to make them easy for Mudlet users to use =)\n",

                  "description": "# GREP\n\nThis alias (and the functions which support it) tries to emulate the `grep` command from *NIX systems, in that it will search your buffer for all the lines which match a pattern and display them on the screen for you.\n\nIt will autodetect how many lines can fit on your main window and paginate the results for you accordingly. This was created after someone asked me if Mudlet could do something like TinTin++'s [grep](https://tintin.mudhalla.net/manual/grep.php) command in the #help channel on the Mudlet discord. It seemed like a good idea, so I threw something together.\n\n## Things to keep in mind\n\nThe output of the `grep` alias adds to the buffer, so future uses of grep (including changing pages) will include the already printed pages at the end. This means for browsing the end of the output you should really use `-1` for the page to print from the get go, IE `grep Bob -1` to show the most recent page of lines with Bob on.\n\n## The future?\n\nI think it might be a slightly cleaner experience to have the alias assemble the output, and then display it in a Miniconsole with the wrapping turned off and the horizontal scroll bar turned on. This way the output you're paging through isn't changing because you're paging through it. But I wanted to go ahead and get this out the door.\n\n## Alias\n\n* `grep <regex pattern to search for> <optional page of the results to display>`\n  * This alias will search the main console buffer for all lines which match the pattern provided. It reads the buffer after it has been word wrapped, which means that it evaluates each line as it appears separately, rather than how it came in from the game originally.\n  * examples:\n    * `grep \\d+ gold coins`\n      * searches the buffer for any line with a number of gold coins on it and prints the outcome.\n    * `grep (?i)goblin 2`\n      * searches the buffer for goblin, ignoring case sensitivity (will match goblin or GoBLin), and print page 2 if there's more than 1 page.\n\n## Functions\n\nI use the `[=[things and stuff]=]` alternate method of string delineation for two reasons\n\n* Using `\"things and stuff\"` means you have to escape every `\\` in your regex\n* This text is included in the package's config.lua, which uses the form without the `=` sign between the brackets, and if I use that it breaks the package.\n\n### `GREP.getLines([win,]pattern)`\n\n  `pattern` is the regular expression you want to search the main buffer for\n  \n  returns a table with all of the matching lines in it, one entry per line\n  \n```lua\n  GREP.getLines([=[\\d+ gold coins]=])\n```\n\nreturns\n\n```txt\n{\n  \"There are 32 gold coins on the floor here\",\n  \"There are 72 gold coins on the floor here\",\n  \"The table has 1928 gold coins upon it\",\n}\n```\n\n### `GREP.grep(pattern, pg)`\n\nPrints out the lines matching the `pattern` to the main window, starting at `pg`. If `pg` is left off, then it defaults to 1. see getPage above for more on the page numbering.\n\n```lua\nGREP.grep([=[\\d+ gold coins]=])\n```\n\n```txt\n(grep): total hits: 5   Pg:1/1\n`echo There are 32 gold coins on the floor here\nThere are 32 gold coins on the floor here\n`echo There are 72 gold coins on the floor here\nThere are 72 gold coins on the floor here\n`echo The table has 1928 gold coins upon it\n(grep):No more pages\n```\n",
