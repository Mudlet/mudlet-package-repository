Since we use busted for testing Mudlet itself I thought it would be good to get a version repackaged which Mudlet users could install for their own use.\n## Usage\n\nThis comes with one alias, `runTests`. By default, it will look for every file in your profile directory named `*_spec.lua` and run the tests defined within. If you wish to only run tests for a specific package, you can use the package name as the argument to the alias, for instance `runTests REPLet` will run any test files in the REPLet package if installed. If you want to run a specific test file, you can use `runTests REPLet/coreTests_spec.lua` to point to the specific file.\n\n## Writing tests\n\nThere are some very good [docs](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/) available from the authors. For some practical examples, you can check out the [Mudlet busted tests](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/tree/development/src/mudlet-lua/tests)\n\n## TO-DO\n\nI have not yet included the libraries to enable asynchronous testing (libev and the copas and lua-libev luarocks) so you won't be able to ","mpackage":"MudletBusted","title":"The Busted testing suite, packaged for Mudlet","version":"2.0.0"},{"author":"Oneymus","created":"2024-06-28T14:07:07+04:00","description":"N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, SE, IN, OUT, UP, DOWN\nassigned to the number pad.","mpackage":"NumPad","title":"Cardinal movement commands assigned to number pad keys.","version":"1"},{"author":"Mudlet Default Package","created":"2023-06-22T12:15:17+10:00","description":"# deleteOldProfiles Package\n\nMudlet continuiously creates backups of important data.
